# Multi-threaded Voxel Terrain Generator
This is an old project I made a few years back to learn a bit more about generating meshes and terrains.

Uses multiple threads to create chunks made of blocks. Uses greedy meshing to improve performance.
Memory usage was not optimized in this project, so RAM usage will be high!

Made in Godot 3.5 using C#
